Fix Missing Pages and Navigation Walkthrough
I have successfully implemented the missing pages and fixed the navigation issues identified in the TestSprite report.

Changes
1. New Pages Created
I created the following pages to resolve 404 errors:

Login Page
Signup Page
MyPage (Dashboard)
Recruit Page
Submission Page
2. Navigation Fixes
Header Component: Refactored 
Header.tsx
 to remove legacyBehavior from Link components and ensure all navigation items point to the correct new paths. Removed duplicate code.
New Component: Added 
Textarea
 to support the Submission page.
